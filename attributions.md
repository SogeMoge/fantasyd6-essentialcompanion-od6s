# This is the document for all the Creative Commons Attributions.

Changes were probably made by running the Creative Commons work through Tokentool to create .webp icons and add a border. This document is a reasonable attempt to attribute appropriately, but this is not to suggest that the licensor endorses this project or the use of the artwork.

If you expand the equipIcons directory, you will see a folder structure that explains where each icon came from.

### REUP_CC: Star Wars Roleplaying Game Rulebook Creative Commons (CC)

The Star Wars Roleplaying Game Revised Expanded Updated rulebook is marked with a Creative Commons license. Many Icons came from there and you can find them in the /art/items/equipIcons/REUP_CC directory.

### WEG_FAIR: Star Wars West End Games Roleplaying Game Content (FAIR USE)

The Star Wars Roleplaying Game was published by West End Games from 1987 to 1998, at which time they lost the license. Items in the /art/items/equipIcons/WEG_FAIR directory contain icons made from these old out-of-print sourcebooks. Actor Tokens are also all from fair use of out of print and open source West End Games content.
