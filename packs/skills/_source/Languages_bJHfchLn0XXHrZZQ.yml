    <p><span class="fontstyle2">The common language of the Known Galaxy is
    Basic. Most people speak it &mdash; if not as their main language, they are
    at least fluent in it &mdash; and virtually everyone can understand it.
    However, some areas of the galaxy are so isolated that Basic is rarely
    spoken. Some aliens can&rsquo;t or refuse to speak Basic. For example,
    Wookiees can under</span><span class="fontstyle2">stand Basic, but, because
    of the structure of their mouths, usually cannot speak it. Ewoks do not
    normally understand Basic, but can learn it fairly easily. </span></p>

    <p><span class="fontstyle2">The </span><span class="fontstyle0">languages
    </span><span class="fontstyle2">skill is used to determine whether or not a
    character understands something in another language. If the character wants
    to say something in a language in which he isn&rsquo;t fluent (see
    &ldquo;specialization&rdquo; below) increase the difficulty by two
    levels.</span></p>

    <p><span class="fontstyle2"><span class="fontstyle0"><strong>Specialization:
    </strong>Characters may specialize in a specific language, such as Wookiee,
    Huttese, or astromech droid. Once the character has 5D in the specialized
    language, the character is considered fluent in the language and no longer
    has to make rolls to understand anything in that language.</span> <br
