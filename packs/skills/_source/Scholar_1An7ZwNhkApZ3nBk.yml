    <p><em><span class="fontstyle1">Specialization: </span><span
    class="fontstyle3">Particular field of study &mdash; </span><span
    class="fontstyle1">archaeology, Jedi lore, history, geology,
    physics</span><span class="fontstyle3">.</span></em></p>

    <p><span class="fontstyle3">This skill reflects formal academic training or
    dedicated research in a particular field. </span><span
    class="fontstyle1">Scholar </span><span class="fontstyle3">also reflects a
    character&rsquo;s ability to find information through research. Characters
    often choose a specialization to reflect a specific area which they have
    studied. Specializations are subjects often taught at the great universities
    throughout the galaxy, including archaeology, botany, chemistry, geology,
    history, hyperspace theories, and physics. Specializations can also be
    topics a character can research on his own. </span></p>

    <p><span class="fontstyle1">Scholar </span><span
    class="fontstyle3">represents &ldquo;book-learning,&rdquo; not information
    learned from practical experience. A character can know the various
    hyperspace theories inside and out, but this doesn&rsquo;t qualify him to
    fly starships through hyperspace (that&rsquo;s covered by the </span><span
    class="fontstyle1">astrogation </span><span class="fontstyle3">skill). He
    might know the physical principles which make a blaster fire, but that
    doesn&rsquo;t make him a better shot. </span></p>

    <p><span class="fontstyle3">Gamemasters can choose to allow players a
    limited benefit under certain circumstances &mdash; the character is
    applying theory in a real-world situation. For example, a character with
    </span><span class="fontstyle1">scholar: military tactics </span><span
    class="fontstyle3">(the history of tactics) doesn&rsquo;t get a bonus to
    </span><span class="fontstyle1">tactics </span><span
    class="fontstyle3">rolls, but under certain circumstances, a good
    </span><span class="fontstyle1">scholar: military tactics </span><span
    class="fontstyle3">roll might merit a small (+1D or so) bonus to
    </span><span class="fontstyle1">tactics.</span></p>

    <p><span class="fontstyle3">Gamemasters should allow players to choose their
    own </span><span class="fontstyle1">scholar </span><span
    class="fontstyle3">specializations &mdash; new ones can be created at the
    gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion. When determining a character&rsquo;s
    background, players should explain why and how they gained such academic
    training in a field.</span></p>

    <p><span class="fontstyle3">Like many other </span><span
    class="fontstyle1">Knowledge </span><span class="fontstyle3">skills, the
    difficulty is based on the obscurity and detail of the information
    sought.</span> <br style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal;
