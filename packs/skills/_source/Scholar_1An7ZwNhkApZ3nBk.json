Characters often choose a specialization to reflect a specific area which they have studied. Specializations are subjects often taught at the great universities throughout the lands, including archaeology, botany, chemistry, geology, history and physics. Specializations can also be topics a character can research on his own.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Scholar </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">represents &ldquo;book-learning,&rdquo; not information learned from practical experience. A character can know the various magic theories inside and out, but this doesn&rsquo;t qualify him to cast spells (that&rsquo;s covered by the metaphysics attribute</span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">). He might know the physical principles bows, but that doesn&rsquo;t make him a marksman.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Gamemasters can choose to allow players a limited benefit under certain circumstances &mdash; the character is applying theory in a real-world situation. For example, a character with </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">scholar: military tactics </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">(the history of tactics) doesn&rsquo;t get a bonus to </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">tactics </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">rolls, but under certain circumstances, a good </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">scholar: military tactics </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">roll might merit a small (+1D or so) bonus to </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">tactics.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Gamemasters should allow players to choose their own </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">scholar </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">specializations &mdash; new ones can be created at the gamemaster&rsquo;s discretion. When determining a character&rsquo;s background, players should explain why and how they gained such academic training in a field.</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Like many other </span><span class=\"fontstyle1\">Knowledge </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">skills, the difficulty is based on the obscurity and detail of the information sought.</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\"><br></p>",
