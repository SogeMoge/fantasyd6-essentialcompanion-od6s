Roll 2D at the beginning of each round; if the total is less than the number of rounds that the character has been drowning, the character drowns and dies. Characters can attempt other actions while drowning at a -3D penalty. Characters who are drowning may attempt to save themselves once per round. They must make a </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">swimming </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">total at one level of difficulty higher than the one in which they failed their </span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">swimming </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">roll (the character doesn&rsquo;t suffer the -3D penalty when making this roll).</span> <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /><br /></p>",
